# Customer-Banking-System-Enhancement

PKDD’99 financial dataset or the Berka Dataset (which is the dataset being used for this project)
provides information on the clients, accounts, and transactions of a Czech bank. The Bank
acknowledges the critical importance of providing tailored services to its clients. However, the
bank is currently facing challenges in accurately identifying high-value clients for targeted
offerings and assessing potential risks associated with certain clients. The bank possesses a
wealth of data pertaining to its customers, including account transactions over several months,
loan histories and issues credit cards. Management recognizes the need for a comprehensive and
actionable approach to leverage this data effectively.

### Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to empower the banking system with precise insights into
customer behavior, preferences, and risk profiles. By utilizing advanced analytical techniques,
the bank aims to refine its understanding of clients and formulate specific strategies for service
improvement. The bank seeks a robust and well-structured approach to ensure convincing
results.
### Scope:
Upon completion of this project, we wish to achieve the following components:
1. Data Analysis: Analyse customer data, including account transactions, loan histories and
credit card information, from relevant sources within the bank.
2. Customer Segmentation: Employ advanced techniques to categorize customers based on
spending patterns, account activity, credit utilization and loan repayment behavior.
3. Risk Assessment: Develop a comprehensive risk assessment model to identify potential
high-risk clients based on historical data, identifying characteristics of clients with higher
default probabilities.
4. Client profiling: Create detailed customer profiles, including demographic information,
financial behavior, and transactional history, to gain a comprehensive understanding of
individual clients.
5. Service customization recommendations: Based on customer segments and risk
assessments, formulate specific recommendations for tailoring services to meet the
unique needs of different client groups.
6. Performance metrics: Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the impact
of service improvements on client satisfaction, retention, and overall profitability.

### Dataset Details:
The Berka dataset is a collection of financial information from a Czech bank. The dataset deals
with over 5,300 bank clients with approximately 1,000,000 transactions. Additionally, the bank
represented in the dataset has extended close to 700 loans and issued 900 credit cards, all of
which are represented in the data.
